# Forex Data Analysis

## Description
This project involves the analysis of forex data, specifically focusing on the EUR/USD currency pair. Utilizing Python and Jupyter Notebook, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, volatility, and relationships within the forex market. The project employs libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `yfinance` to download, process, and visualize historical forex data.

## Features
- **Data Collection:** Download historical forex data using the `yfinance` library.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Generate descriptive statistics and visualize the data to identify trends.
- **Volatility Analysis:** Calculate and visualize the rolling volatility of the currency pair.
- **Moving Averages:** Compute and plot moving averages to highlight trends.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Analyze the correlation between different currency pairs (e.g., EUR/USD and GBP/USD).
- **Data Export:** Save processed data for future use.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can then install the required libraries using pip:
